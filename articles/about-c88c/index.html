    </header>
     <blockquote><p>CS 88, DATA C88C, "88C"... It's all the same. :)</p></blockquote>


<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>


<p>CS 88 is a "connector" for Data 8 that is
designed for students who would like a more complete introduction to
Computer Science. We will cover a
variety of topics such as functional programming, data abstraction,
object-oriented programming, and program complexity.
This course will be taught primarily in Python.
However, we are interested in teaching you foundational programming ideas, not
just how to use one particular programming language.
Once you have learned the essence of programming and the concepts that
appear in various forms in programming languages, you will be able to
pick up other languages and other programming concepts rapidly.</p>

<p>The material for this course has significant overlap with CS 61A. We do not cover
the interpretation section of CS61A. If you are certain that you want to
major or minor in Computer Science, CS 61A is the right introductory
course.  You can take CS 61A for credit after having taken CS 88.
However, you cannot take CS 88 for credit after having taken CS 61A.
Data 8 and CS 88 together satisfy the knowledge prerequisite for CS 61B.</p>


<h3 id="exams-amp-proctoring">Exams &amp; Proctoring</h3>


<p>We will have two exams, a midterm and a final exam. Dates are on the primary calendar. For each exam, we expect students to take the exam in person at the time of the exam. If you have a verified academic or religious conflict, please contact the course staff as soon as possible. We will have limited alternatives available.</p>


<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>


<p>It is recommended, but not strictly required, that you are currently enrolled in or have taken Data 8.
There is no formal programming-related prerequisite for
CS 88. You do not need to be familiar with any particular
programming language.</p>


<h2 id="course-activities">Course Activities</h2>


<p><strong>Lecture:</strong> There will be two 50-minute lectures per week. We strongly encourage you to attend lectures, but will not enforce this. Lecture recordings will be posted online, typically the next day.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture Self-Checks:</strong> Every lecture will have a short series of questions, which can be answered during or online after the lecture. These questions will help check your understanding. Each lecture "quiz" is worth 1 point, and are due roughly 48 hours after each lecture, however You have unlimited attempts during that period.</p>

<p><strong>Labs:</strong> This course also includes weekly two-hour "lab" sections.
The first hour will be going over a discussion-based worksheet and writing code on paper.
The second hour will be writing code on your own computer.</p>

<p>Each lab section will be lead by a teaching assistant, and are designed to be interactive. Labs assignments are short, relatively simple exercises designed to introduce a new topic.</p>

<p>Most lab assignments are designed to be completed within the two hour time slot.</p>

<p>Labs will generally be released on Monday (subject to change), and are due Friday by 11:59 PM PST. They are graded on correctness.</p>

<p><strong>Homework:</strong> There will usually be one homework assignment per week that will be more involved and
are meant to illustrate and explore new topics. You are encouraged to discuss the
homework with other students, but your final solution should be developed alone.
Homework will be graded on correctness.</p>

<p>Homework will generally be released on every Tuesday, and is due 8 days after release date, Wednesdays by 11:59 PM PST.</p>

<p><strong>Projects:</strong> There will be 2 projects intended to teach you how to
combine ideas from the course in interesting ways. Projects will be graded on correctness.</p>

<p>Project release/due dates will be communicated on the course calendar/Ed page.</p>

<p>Projects will offer extra credit for early submission.</p>

<p><strong>Exams:</strong> This course will have one in-person midterm and one in-person final. Exact details will be provided soon.</p>

<p><strong>Office Hours:</strong> Attending office hours is another great way to succeed in
this course. Office hours are held by TAs and the instructor each week. An
office hours schedule appears on the course website.
In office hours, you can ask questions about the material, receive guidance on
assignments, work with peers and course staff in a small group setting, find
project partners, and learn about computer science at Berkeley.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Sections:</strong> In addition to the weekly class meetings, the course
will include optional events such as review sessions and tutoring sections that are designed to help
you master the course material and complete the assignments.
Details of these events will be announced as they approach.</p>


<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>


<p>The online textbook for the course is <a href="https://www.composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>, which was
created specifically for CS61A but is also the best basis for this course.
Readings for each lecture appear in the course schedule.
We will be jumping around a little due to the data-centric
orientation of the course. You should complete the readings before
attending lecture.</p>

<p>In addition, the course website and Ed will contain additional links to
guides, handouts, and practice materials available for the course.</p>


<h2 id="chatgpt-ai-tools-and-the-internet">ChatGPT, AI Tools and The Internet</h2>


<p>While you may search for <em>conceptual</em> questions, e.g. "How do I add an item to a list in Python", you <strong>may not search under any circumstances for specific questions assigned in class.</strong></p>

<p>This policy applies whether you're using ChatGPT, Google Search, or talking with your peers–which are all useful resources!</p>

<p>On your assignments you will be asked to cite what sources you consulted, similar to a research paper. (Though not so formally.) Code is like writing and ideas, it gets built up from many previous examples and ideas, and we should cite those.</p>


<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>


<p>Your course grade is computed using a point system with the following distribution:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th rowspan="2" width="20ch">Category</th>
			<th rowspan="2" width="15ch">Num Graded</th>

<p>This means the total points scale is out of 400 points. In this class, we will use
grading bins to determine your grade, so you will know the number of points you
need to get your desired grade in the class. Remember, with grading bins, there are no comparisons to your peers,
no curves, no guessing or complex formulas.</p>


<h3 id="grade-bins">Grade Bins</h3>


<pre><code>              A  ≥ 380    A&#x2d;  ≥ 360
 B+  ≥ 330    B  ≥ 312    B&#x2d;  ≥ 292
 C+  ≥ 274    C  ≥ 258    C&#x2d;  ≥ 232
              D  ≥ 172</code></pre>


<h3 id="attendance-options">Attendance Options</h3>


<p>You will have noticed that there are two grading options: With or Without attendance. During weeks 3 or 4, we will send out a form where <em>you</em> get to choose whether attending weekly sections are part of your grade calculation.</p>

<p>We encourage you to consider the benefits of attending sections, as they provide valuable opportunities for discussion, collaboration, and support.
However, this means you must also commit to showing up regularly, as we will not be able to accommodate exemptions for when you miss class.
(Attending 10 sections will earn you full credit, as we recognize that sometimes you are ill or life gets in the way...)</p>


<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>


<ul>
  <li><em>Self-Checks</em>: We will count your 20 best self-check submissions. (There are typically 1 self-check per lecture. "Bonus" self-checks are for practice, but can replace and missing self-check questions.)</li>
  <li><em>Clobber Policy</em>: This allows your final exam to replace your midterm score, if it is better based on the percentage. That is, your midterm score is always <code>max(midterm&#x2d;%, final&#x2d;%) * midterm_points pts</code>. (<code>midterm_points</code> is the total points possible on the midterm, either 70 or 80 points, depending on the grading option you choose.)</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h2>

<p>Everyone has <strong>9 slip days</strong>, which can be applied to late submissions of labs, homework, and projects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each assignment can have a <strong>max of 3 slip days</strong> applied to it. These slip days will be automatically applied at the end of the semester to maximize your grade.</li>
  <li><p>If you have no remaining slip days, there is a -25% reduction to your total score for every day that the assignment is late.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>After 3 late days, you can no longer receive credit for the submission, unless an extension has been approved before the assignment deadline.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For exceptional circumstances, please fill out the <a href="https://go.c88c.org/extensions">extension form</a>. When making extension requests, please:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Send requests before the assignment deadline</li>
  <li>Send one extension request per assignment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assignment Drops:</strong> We will drop your lowest homework and lab score from your final grade calculation.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Checks:</strong> Lecture self-checks are not eligible for slip days. You will receive full credit for late submissions, as long as they are open on Gradescope. These are graded on correctness, but you have infinite attempts. <strong>Self-Checks must be correct to earn full points.</strong></p>


<h2 id="device-lending-options">Device Lending options</h2>

<p>Students can access device lending options through the Student Technology Equity Program <a href="https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/devicelending">STEP program</a>.</p>


<h2 id="data-science-student-climate">Data Science Student Climate</h2>

<p><a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs">Data Science Undergraduate Studies</a> faculty and staff are committed to creating a community where every person feels <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/equity-inclusion">respected, included, and supported</a>. We recognize that incidents may happen, sometimes unintentionally, that run counter to this goal. There are many things we can do to try to improve the climate for students, but we need to understand where the challenges lie. If you experience a remark, or disrespectful treatment, or if you feel you are being ignored, excluded or marginalized in a course or program-related activity, please speak up. Consider talking to your instructor, but you are also welcome to contact Executive Director Christina Teller at cpteller@berkeley.edu or report an incident anonymously through this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBwaUe7VMQz6VzkYFvf4KYwNSTve9iJlBSQyAmsXoSE0LnWw/viewform">online form</a>.</p>


<h2 id="community-standards">Community Standards</h2>

<p>Ed is a formal, academic space. We must demonstrate appropriate respect, consideration, and compassion for others. Please be friendly and thoughtful; our community draws from a wide spectrum of valuable experiences. For further reading, please reference <a href="https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community">Berkeley’s Principles of Community</a> and the <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Code%20of%20Conduct_January%202016.pdf">Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct</a>.</p>


<h2 id="learning-cooperatively">Learning Cooperatively</h2>


<p>With the obvious exception of exams and take-home quizzes, we encourage you to
discuss <em>all</em> of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you
are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work
with others than if you do not.  Ask questions, answer questions, and share
ideas liberally.</p>

<p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and TA
informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course
for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason,
please don't just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner,
so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can't finish.</p>


<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>


<p>Cooperation has a limit, however, and in CS 88 that limit is sharing code. Feel
free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but not the code that
solves them. Projects can be completed in pairs. You can share
everything with your partner. Do not share your code with anyone but your
partner, and do not read anyone but your partner's code. Do not post your
solutions online. Do not use pastebin or GitHub, which post your work publicly
by default. Do not read solutions that you find online. Write your own programs
and keep them to yourself. In the case of office hours, sections, and in the presence of a TA, you may see someone else's code to help them debug, but you should not use this as a guide to your own solution.</p>

<p>If you find a solution online, please email a link to that solution to the instructor.</p>

<p>We expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and complete your
own projects. The assignments and evaluations are structured to help you
learn, which is why you're here. The course staff works hard to put together
this course, and we ask in return that you respect the integrity of the course
by not misrepresenting your work.</p>

<p>The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, "Copying all or part of
another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed,
are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated." The policy statement goes on
to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the
test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>In this class, cheating on an assignment can result in -100% on that assignment.</strong>
<strong>Cheating on an exam can result in an F in the course and a report to the the Center for Student Conduct, as well as giving up the ability to clobber the exam</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The creation of computer programs is the most rewarding and the same time most frustrating activity: As exhilarating as it is when a program works, as frustrating can it be when it doesn't. This frustration, however, is a very important part of the learning experience: You are sharpening your own analytical skills by having the computer constantly test your hypotheses. Sharing code and short cutting the mental discovery process that goes along with creating code strips you off the most important part of this class. If you find you are running out of ideas, take a break and do something else, then go back to it. If you end up not finding a solution after major time spent, try to formulate in your head what your most constructive question would be and seek help from a peer, a TA, or the professor. The TAs, academic interns, and instructor are all here to help you succeed. If you cannot solve a problem in time for the deadline, try to come as close as you can, even if you might not end up getting points for it.  You are attending Berkeley for the experience, not for the grades. Don't strip yourself off that experience by copying somebody else's code.</p>


<h2 id="a-parting-thought">A Parting Thought</h2>


<p>The main goal of this course is to help you learn and enjoy the material.
Please don't hesitate to reach out to the staff for any questions or concerns.
We are here to help you however we can. Welcome to CS 88!</p>
